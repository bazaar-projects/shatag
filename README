Shatag is a collection of tools to compute, store and use sha256 checksums in the filesystem.


Before you attempt to use it, make sure the filesystem you will be working on has
support for extended attributes (remount them with the user_xattr option if needed).

Summary of tools:

* mkshatag [-vf] FILES...
  
 Will compute sha256 checksums, using the sha256sum(1) tool, and store it in the extended
 attribute "user.htag.sha256". The modification time of the file will also be recorded in
 "user.htag.ts". 

* lshatag [FILES...]

 Will output the cached checksums in an output format compatible with sha256sum(1).
 If the cache is non-existent, "<unknown>" will be displayed. If the actual modification
 time does not match the cached modification time, "<outdated>" will be displayed.

* findshatag [...]

 Wrapper for find(1) that will display cached sums


TODO: 
  * something that sorts the output of findshatag(1) to find duplicates
  * something that fetches the tags and stores it in sqlite for remote usage
